title: 3D Printing
---

Alright, so one of my main hobbies is 3D printing. It's such an amazing tool to have in your arsenal as a creator, tinkerer or creative artist.

You can so quickly whip something together in a CAD software, and sit with it in your hands in a short time later. The fact you can print stuff other people have made, is amazing too.

## My Gear

I'm currently sporting a Creality CR-6 SE, with a couple of upgrades.

### Upgrades
Here is a list of upgrades i've done to my printer.

#### Dual gear extruder
This should allow me to more easily use softer filaments like TPU. It's also makes it a more stable extuder.

#### PEI bed plate
I have ditched the old stock glass bed, which I had a ton of adhesion issues with. Now I use a nice powder coated PEI plate, that is mounted magnetically, and is flexiable. Which also makes the print adhere better, and very easy to remove when cooled off.

#### Capricon bowden tube
This is just a better PTFE bowden tube from Capricon

#### PrimaCreator Ruby nozzle 0.4mm
This nozzle should allow me to print with various abbrasive filaments, without nozzle weardown.

#### Custom firmware (Community firmware)
I have flashed the better community firmware, that adds a bunch of new features.

### Future upgrades
I'm planning on upgrading the Hotend to the MicroSwiss all metal hotend, which should help with potentional heat creep issues.
