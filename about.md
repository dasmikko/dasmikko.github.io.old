	Hey there! Here you can read a little about who I am, and what I do.
</p>

![me](http://lambda.sx/7aF)

My name is Mikkel, and I'm 21 years old.

I spent most of my waking hours on my work and my lovely Wife.

I love to code in different languanges, and I'm strongest in the following:

- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Io.js

I have used to work with these framworks/CMS:

- Laravel (PHP)
- Kohana (PHP)
- Wordpress

I love to make applications with NW.js (AKA Node-webkit) as it's easy, and you can make sweet looking UX with ease.

Feel free to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Dasmikko "My twitter profile") for more updates and such.
