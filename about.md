	Hey there! Here you can read a little about who I am, and what I do.

![me](http://mikkel.stopregn.dk/games/me-small.png)

My name is Mikkel, and I'm 21 years old.

I spent most of my waking hours on my work and my lovely Wife.

I love to code in different languanges, and I'm strongest in the following:
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- Javascript

I have used to work with these framworks/CMS:
- Laravel (PHP)
- Kohana (PHP)
- Wordpress

At the moment I make games using [Phaser.js](phaser.io "Phaser framework") which is super fun, and easy to use.
Take a look at my first game [pong](http://dasmikko.github.io/public/games/pong-game/ "Pong game")

Feel free to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Dasmikko "My twitter profile") for more updates and such.
